# web-component-designs
This repo contains buttons, alerts, and other components built with tailwindcss and normal html5/css3. It also contains designed pages / templates.

I am using tailwindcss to design web components that are usually used in web design and development. This includes
- buttons
- alerts
- navbars 
- footers
- e.t.c
